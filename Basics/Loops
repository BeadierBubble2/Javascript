for loop
  contains three expression
     1. initialization 
        - starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable
     2. stopping condition
        - the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated againstâ€” if the condition 
          evaluates to true the code block will run, and if it evaluates to false the code will stop
     3. iteration statement
        - used to update the iterator variable on each loop
 ______________
 Example:
 
 for (let counter = 0; counter < 4; counter++) {
  console.log(counter);
}

let counter = 0 // initialization- the loop starts at 0
counter < 4 // stopping condition - the loop will run as long is less than 4
counter++ // iteration statement - after each loop, the value of counter will increase by 1. For the first iteration counter will equal 0, 
                                   for the second iteration counter will equal 1, and so on
