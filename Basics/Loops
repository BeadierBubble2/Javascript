Three types of loops
    1. for loop
    2. while loop
    3. do...while loop
_______________

for loop
  contains three expression
     1. initialization 
        - starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable
     2. stopping condition
        - the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated againstâ€” if the condition 
          evaluates to true the code block will run, and if it evaluates to false the code will stop
     3. iteration statement
        - used to update the iterator variable on each loop
 
 Example:
 
 for (let counter = 1; counter < 4; counter++) {
  console.log(counter);
}

let counter = 1 // initialization- the loop starts at 1
counter < 4 // stopping condition - the loop will run as long is less than 4
counter++ // iteration statement - after each loop, the value of counter will increase by 1. For the first iteration counter will equal 0, 
                                   for the second iteration counter will equal 1, and so on
{} // the block of code to executed until the stopping condition
                                   
_________________________________________                                   
while loop

let counterTwo = 1;
while (counterTwo < 4) {
  console.log(counterTwo);
  counterTwo++;
}

counterTwo++ //Without the increament if would loop infinitely

when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, while loops are the best choice.

____________________
do...while loop

let text = "";
let i = 0;
do {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
while (i < 5);

the difference is the block will be executed at least once before the checking the stopping condition
_________________
Break
  -Within the loop, it will exit the loop immmediately
  
for (let i = 0; i < 99; i += 1) {
  if (i > 5) {
     break;
  }
  console.log(i)
}
// Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5
_______________________
Reverse loop

const items = ['apricot', 'banana', 'cherry'];

for (let i = items.length - 1; i >= 0; i -= 1) {
  console.log(`${i}. ${items[i]}`);
}

// Prints: 2. cherry
// Prints: 1. banana
// Prints: 0. apricot
___________________
Looping through the Arrays

const animals = ['Grizzly Bear', 'Sloth', 'Sea Lion'];
for (let i = 0; i < animals.length; i++){
  console.log(animals[i]);
}

//Prints Grizzly Bear
//Prints Sloth
//Prints Sea Lion
